You don't gotta tell me. I know who I am. You don't gotta tell me. Don't pretend you're my friend.

Wherever I go, same faces will stare. Just one people. I see no division over there. 

Cause we are

We're not blue, we're not red. I'm not blue, I'm not red. I'm an American just like you. You tell me I'm blue—I'm not blue. You tell me I'm red—I'm not red. I'm an American and proud to lift my head.

never bow down oh nooo
never get down, don't play their game oh ohhh

just like i said I'm not red.  I'm not blue. I'm an American like you.

From the west to the east, from the north to the south, just one people living joined by our hearts 

that's enough

just one people

dem try to divide 
but we 

are one people

not anyone else.
